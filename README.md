# Voice News #
- A News Reader App that categorises News into three categories :-
     - Health
     - Business
     - Sports
- ***Alan AI*** API was used in order to configure the voice commands.
- User has to hit the button on the bottom right side of the screen and has to say out loud the news category he/she wishes to read.
- The rest of the work will be done automatically . This was done with the help of **React Hooks** (primarily useState and useEffect).
- Working on automatic news reading feature.
